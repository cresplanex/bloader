# Commands ðŸ“¤

The `bloader` provides many commands in addition to running load tests. Most commands use [Config file](../configuration/index.md) is required for most commands.

{: .highlight }
However, some commands listed in the [Base Commands](#base-commands) section do not require a configuration file.

{: .warning }
> In addition, there are commands available only for slave and commands available only for master. The appropriate configuration file must be selected.

If you want to specify a configuration file on a per-command basis, check the [Command Options](#common-options) section.

#### Common Options

- `--config`
  Bloader explores configuration files in the following order by default: `$PWD`, `$HOME`, `/etc/bloader`. It searches for `bloader.*` files (supported formats align with [Viper's supported formats](https://github.com/spf13/viper?tab=readme-ov-file#reading-config-files)). To override this behavior, use the `-c` (or `--config`) option:

  ```bash
  bloader {command} -c bloader/config.yaml
  ```
- `--help`
  You can display help for any command using the `-h` (or `--help`) option. You can also learn about valid options for commands, etc.
